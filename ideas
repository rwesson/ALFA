1. continuum:
    - include discontinuities
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
2. overall fit in chunks, 20 or so lines at a time
    - fit strongest lines to estimate redshift and resolution
    - restrict the variation of these and then fit all the lines in chunks
3. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
4. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
5. ion identification in output line list, use better file names
6. latex tables option
7. use cfitsio to read in fits files
8. command line options:
     min and max wavelength
     initial guess of redshift and resolution
