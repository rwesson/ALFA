0. uncertainties:
     generate synthetic spectra with one line and increasing noise
     fit with dipso
     fit with alfa, compare, use to diagnose correct uncertainty calculation
1. continuum:
    - include discontinuities
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
    - try calculating gradients to mask lines
    - first differencing
2. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
3. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
4. use cfitsio to read in fits files
5. allow choice of fitting with constant width or constant resolution
6. use first differences to identify unfitted lines, take the top few differences which are not near fitted lines and report them
7. sort out the issue of lines falling outside the chunk.
